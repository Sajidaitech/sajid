            <h2>Week 7</h2>
        <p>This week marks a significant milestone in my final year project as I officially begin coding for the frontend and backend. 
            Having spent the past few weeks on research, planning, and architecture, it's exciting to finally bring everything to life through development.</p>

<h2>Frontend Development</h2>
<p>I am using Next.js for the frontend to ensure a smooth, responsive, and user-friendly interface. This framework provides server-side rendering 
    (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimized performance, making it ideal for a virtual classroom application where speed and interactivity 
    are crucial.</p>

<p>This week, I set up the project structure and implemented essential UI components for user authentication, classroom management, and session scheduling. 
    Additionally, I focused on building a role-based dashboard layout, ensuring that each user role (student, teacher, admin) has a tailored interface to
    enhance user experience and functionality.</p>

<p>For global state management, I integrated Context API or Redux, enabling seamless data flow across components, ensuring data consistency, and improving 
    application performance. I also integrated NextAuth for secure authentication and dynamic routing to ensure a seamless and intuitive user journey through 
    different sections of the platform.</p>

<h2>Backend Development</h2>
<p>For the backend, I am using NestJS, a powerful Node.js framework, to build scalable and maintainable APIs. MongoDB is used for authentication and as the 
    primary data store to ensure a more efficient and responsive system. I have implemented authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to safeguard access and 
    maintain user session integrity. Additionally, I developed API endpoints for virtual classroom creation, assignment management, and attendance tracking, 
    leveraging NestJS’s modular architecture for better organization and maintainability.</p>
